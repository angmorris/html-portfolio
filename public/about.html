<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Angelina Morris. I am currently a computer science major at Valencia College, 
  and hope to transfer to Florida State University in Fall 2024. I graduated from West Orange 
  High School in 2023. I am an Aries, and love any and all sports.</p>

<p>This is my first ever "portfolio." This portfolio houses some of my first 
  html projects, and is simply for practice.</p>

<p>I doubt that anyone will come across this page, but if you do, please know that by the time 
  you see this my skills will have progressed an exponential amount and my up-to-date portfolio
  will exceed your expectations. Thank you for reading :)</p>
